# Laughing Train

On a quest to make paperwork and document managing great again.

## Disclaimer

This project was designed during a mini-hackaton. We decided to make this project public from the get-go because... why not.

## How it works

We can't scan documents for you, so that step is up to you. Wether you want to use a scanner or your mobile phone, it's your choice.

What we can do for you is:

- Indexing your documents;
- Creating a selectable PDF so you can copy/paste text from it;
- Translating the text content in case you received a paper that is not in a language you understand;
- Security and privacy.

## Planned features

- Private and secure, end-to-end encryption (hopefully, we don't want to commit on that yet but it's the plan).
- Document upload (PDF or picture).
- Text content extraction.
- Content translation.
- Overview of all your uploaded documents.
